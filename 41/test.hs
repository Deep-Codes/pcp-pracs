-- in cmd write list and it'll generate the result
list = map (\x -> x ^ 4) [1 .. 50]

-- in map function the structure is like
--map(aVariable -> operation performed on aVariable) anyList
-- anyList :: you can declare a list first or you can directly write while --using
-- map function just like above we wrote [1..50]
